Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort,2005 KƒÅlia Rd,Honolulu,HI,96815,USA,06/26,07/01,2/5,2/5,4.5/5,N/A,4/5,4/5,N/A,,"Resort, Ocean",3/5,Amazing balcony and view. Location awkwardly between two areas of interest. Room was very old (but not disgusting) and terrible water pressure and temperature. Very busy and loud. Elevators were hectic. Bathroom was uncomfortably small.
Hyatt Centric Waikiki Beach,349 Seaside Ave,Honolulu,HI,96815,USA,07/01,07/09,3.5/5,4/5,3/5,2.5/5,4/5,4/5,N/A,,City,4/5,"King Deluxe (?) room. Great room for working, had two desks. No balcony. Beautiful bathroom, with ridiculously large shower and tub, and bidet toilet. Very clean and modern."
Hyatt Regency San Antonio Riverwalk,123 Losoya St,San Antonio,TX,78205,USA,07/11,07/12,2.5/5,2.5/5,2/5,3.5/5,3.5/5,1.5/5,N/A,,City,2.5/5,"Older style room, but pretty clean and good shower pressure and toiletries. But service seemed standoffish and annoyed, and location was probably objectively good but not to our taste. Lobby was nicely designed though, nice glass elevator. Big gym but could be even better equipped."
